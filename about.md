Hello, I am Commodore Surprised Patrick. Why Surprised Patrick, you ask? Well, I always have this reaction when doing most school work. Anyways, join me on my endeavors of learning Python. I may just teach you a thing or two. 

### More Information

Funniness aside, I have some experience in web design and am very excited to be learning to design a website using GitHub and Jekyll. Currently, I am in the works of upgrading the website of UCLA's professional chemistry fraternity, Alpha Chi Sigma. To check out my progress feel free to go to this [link](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/axe).
